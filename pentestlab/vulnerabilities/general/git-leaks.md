# Git Leaks

## Introduction

In this exercise we are going to cover the exploitation of a website that leaks its .git repository in the root of the website. With modern URL mapping (i.e. not relaying on the filesystem) , it's less and less common to see this kind of issues but it's always important to look for them anyway.

## Exploitation

Here, we can access the .git directory in the root of the web server directly. We can also see that directory listing is enabled making the task of retrieving the content of the repository trivial.

For example, you can use the command `wget` in recursive mode `-r` to download everything.

Once you download most of the content (you don't need it all, just try from time to time while wget is running), you can get access to the source code by running git diff.

With this information, you should be able to find the key to solve this exercise that is hidden in the PHP comment of one of the .php file.

## Conclusion

This exercise showed you how you can download the source code of a website if the `.git` repository is exposed. I hope you enjoyed learning with PentesterLab.
