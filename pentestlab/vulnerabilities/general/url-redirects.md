## Redirect

Open Redirect vulnerabilities allows you to redirect the victim to a malicious website. They are low impact vulnerabilities in most cases unless you can use them to leak Oauth tokens.

The developer made the assumption that only a path/URI can start with `/`. However, it's possible to bypass this mechanism by using `//`.
