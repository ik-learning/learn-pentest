1. What we want to find are all the line with a call to the command passwd:

```
grep passwd .bash_history
```

2. However, this only give us the call to passwd. Thankfully, we can ask grep to provide use the following line with:

```
grep -A 1 passwd .bash_history
```

Finally, we can wrap this in a find command:

```
find . -name .bash_history -exec grep -A 1 passwd {} \;
```

Unfortunately, we get too many results as our grep also match lines containing /etc/passwd. We can ask grep to only match the line starting with passwd by using ^:

```
find . -name .bash_history -exec grep -A 1 '^passwd' {} \;
```
