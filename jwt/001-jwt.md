# JWT None

## Empty Signature Examples

```
Base64(Header).Base64(Data).
```

## The vulnerability
This issue was originally discussed in the following blog post: https://auth0.com/blog/2015/03/31/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/.

In this article, Tim McLean discussed multiple issues in the signature mechanism used by JWT. In this exercise, we are going to focus on the first issue.

Multiple signature methods can be used to ensure the integrity of JWT:

- RSA based
- Elliptic curves
- HMAC
- None
- Like SSL (with the NULL Cipher), JWT support a None algorithm for signature. This was probably introduced to debug applications. However, this can have a severe impact on the security of the application.

Exploitation
To exploit this vulnerability, you just need to decode the JWT and change the algorithm used for the signature. Then you can submit your new JWT. However, this won't work unless you remove the signature. If you think like a developer, it actually makes a lot of sense. If you had to develop a JWT library, you will start by generating all the signatures you need to support as it allows you to compare your implementation to others. Then you will create a generic verification method that compare what you get from the JWT with the signature you are generating (based on the algorithm in the header). Since you don't generate any signature with the None algorithm, you will ensure that the signature is empty. Therefore, as an attacker, you need to provide an empty signature.

Conclusion
This exercise showed you how you can tamper with a JWT to gain administrator access in the application. It showed you that having a signed value is only as strong as the weakest algorithm used if an attacker can pick what algorithm is used. I hope you enjoyed learning with PentesterLab.
