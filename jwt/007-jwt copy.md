# JWT None

## Empty Signature Examples

```
Base64(Header).Base64(Data).
```

## The vulnerability

This course details the exploitation of a weakness in the usage of JSON Web Token (JWT). In this application, JWT is used for authentication. Upon successful login, the user is issued a JWT in a cookie. This exercise is a very common covers a very common issue in application using JWT: not verifying the token's signature.

If you feel confident, you can try to do this exercise without following the course, then you can come back to the course to read some details and tips. If you want to do it by yourself, you can follow the following steps:

Create one user.
Inspect the token (header and body).
Tamper with the token to gain admin access.
Exploitation
To exploit this issue, you just need to modify the payload of the JWT to change your username to admin. Since the application doesn't verify the signature, you can leave the signature as it's.

Conclusion
This exercise showed you another way to tamper with a JWT to gain administrator access in an application. It showed you that having a signature is only a security mechanism if it gets verified. Unfortunately, this issue is very common with modern web applications.
