## General Documentation

JSON Web Tokens are a storage mechanism for data. JWT can provide the following security mechanisms:

- Encryption.
- Signature.

JWT follow the following pattern:

`Base64(Header).Base64(Data).Base64(Signature)`

The header contains information on the security mechanisms used. For example, the following header: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXUyJ9 contains the following information:

{ "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWS"}

The header is signed. However, it's a catch 22 problem: if you want to sign the header, you will need the header to verify the signature and the signature to verify the header. Signing the header doesn't prevent an attacker to tamper with the header and change the algorithm used for the signature. However, the server will still verify the signature (and therefore the content of the header).
